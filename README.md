Canvas - Joomla Responsive Template Framework, built with Bootstrap & LESS
==============

The 3rd generation of Canvas Framework - forked from the t3 framework to support Bootstrap & LESS & widgets.  


Why?
- No longer the Mobile layout/view but the rise of Responsive Design
- Bootstrap integration into Joomla 3.x 
- LESS development 
- Support Megamenu, Offcanvas, and Sticky menu
- ThemeMagic ( lets you customize themes without having to search for the right file or without diving into the code )
- widgets
- navigation positions
- component area mobility
These things have opened a whole new way of how a Joomla template should be developed.
